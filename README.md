# Magic The Gathering Scraping Prices

*[This script no longer works due to new updates on LigaMagic, no longer loading the whole price table on page load and instead is using JavaScript. Needs complete rework #TODO]*

This is a little program for web scrapping the prices from Magic: The Gathering cards from LigaMagic website. 
It uses a Telegram bot as input, where you type the name of the card, and if the program finds it it returns card info.

```
$ sudo pip3 install bs4
$ sudo pip3 install beautifultable
$ yaourt lxml (parsing)
```
